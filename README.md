# 💸 The Ultimatum Game: GitHub PR Edition

In this assignment, you’ll practice creating branches, pull requests, and responding to code reviews using GitHub.

You are given $100. You must decide how much to offer to your "partner." A bot will act as your partner and decide whether to accept or reject your offer.

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Practice using GitHub Pull Requests (PRs)
- Understand code review and merge processes
- Experience a bit of behavioral economics

---

## 🧪 The Scenario

You and your partner (a GitHub bot) have received **$100**.  
You will make an offer like:

> "I offer $25 to my partner."

The bot will evaluate your offer and either:

- ✅ **Accept** (if it's fair): You both get the money.
- ❌ **Reject** (if it's too low): No one gets anything.

---

## 🛠️ Steps

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a new branch** called something like `offer-branch`.

3. **Create a new file** called `offer.txt` in the root of your repo.

4. In `offer.txt`, write a sentence like:

I offer $X to my partner.

Replace `X` with any amount from 0 to 100.

5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** from your new branch into `main`.

6. Wait for the **Offer Bot** to review your PR:
- If your offer is **$30 or more**, the bot will **accept** it.
- If it is **less than $30**, the bot will **reject** it.

7. Based on the bot’s comment:
- If accepted: ✅ Merge the PR.
- If rejected: ❌ Close the PR without merging.

## 💡 Tips

- You can try multiple PRs with different offers—just use different branches or different commits.
- Think about fairness: What offer would you accept if you were the partner?
